# Authentication System (SocialOAuth + CustomAuth).

This project demonstrates a production-style authentication system supporting both custom email/password login and OAuth-based social authentication using Google, GitHub, Facebook, and Twitter.
It implements secure token-based authentication, automatic user creation on first social login, and a role-based access control system that restricts API routes and dashboards based on user permissions. 
The project focuses on real-world authentication architecture, secure identity handling, and scalable user management patterns commonly used in SaaS platforms.
